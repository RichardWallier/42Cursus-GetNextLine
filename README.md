## its a function to read content line by line, guided by a BUFFER_SIZE
### Usage
``make`` without bonus functions.

``make bonus`` to compile with bonuses.

When compiling with your main.c, you need to define a Buffer size using the flag ```-D BUFFER_SIZE <size>``` before the .c archives.

## OBS: with larger buffer size, minus processing but more memory usage and vice versa.
